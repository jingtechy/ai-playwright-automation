# AI Playwright Automation

Lightweight project that generates Playwright tests from natural-language scenarios and runs them against https://the-internet.herokuapp.com.


Quickstart

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Install Playwright browsers: `npm run playwright:install`
- Run in dev: `npm run dev` (requires `ts-node-dev`) or build and run with `npm run build && npm start`.
- Open `http://localhost:3000` and enter a scenario (e.g. "Test the checkboxes").

Environment

- `LOCAL_LLM_URL` - optional local LLM endpoint that accepts `{ prompt }` JSON and returns `{ text }`.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - optional; if set, OpenAI is used as a fallback.

Local secrets

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local secret values (this file is git-ignored).

Example

- Enter "Test the checkboxes" in the UI and press "Generate & Run" to produce and execute a Playwright script against the checkboxes page.

Security & Notes

- Scripts generated by an LLM should be reviewed before running in production. The fallback generator produces minimal scripts for demo purposes.


Configuration

- Optional: set `LOCAL_LLM_URL` to a local LLM endpoint that accepts `{ prompt }` JSON and returns `{ text }`.
- Optional: set `OPENAI_API_KEY` to use OpenAI instead.

Notes

- The project includes a simple LLM fallback that generates a basic test if no model is available.
